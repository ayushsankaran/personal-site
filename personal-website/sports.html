				<li><b>Basketball</b>: My favorite team are the Miami Heat. I like this team because my favorite basketball player every is Dwyane Wade and he played for them for majority of his career. Last seeasom, the Heat were able to make it to the NBA finals and surprised everyone. However they fell to Lebron James and the Lakers in six games.<br><<iframe width="560" height="250" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Knn__3DTeDs" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></li>
				<li><b>Soccer</b>: In soccer my favorite team is Manchester United. I only ever followed the English Premier League so my favorite team is from that league. Specifically, I chose Manchester United because at the time Wayne Rooney played for the team. <br><iframe width="560" height="250" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tEttwxUBqr8" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></li>
				<li><b>Football</b>: My favorite football team is the New York Giants. I started supporting this team because my dad was a Giants fan. My favorite player was Victor Cruz but he retired. On the current roster, my favorite player is Blake Martinez. Since their Super Bowl runs, my favorite season was the 2016 season.<br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qNvyer5jPkU" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></li>
				<li><b>Tennis</b>: In tennis my favorite player is Novak Djokovic because he is very entertaining to watch. Also he is one of three most dominate players in this decade.<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/61vRK7S1TE4?controls=0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></li>
				<li><b>Baseball</b>: I don't watch baseball too much but my favorite team are the New York Yankees because they are a local team. Also they hit a lot of homeruns and make watching the games more interesting.<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nI5cAJAMIW8?controls=0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></li>
